# Project 1 

spacecadet.surge.sh

This is the first project of the course. 

## Space Cadet book club 

The goal of this app is to create a sort of virtual book club where people can search for specific books but also be able to buy them o the Google play book store. Basing it off a community orientated / social media vibe but for books. 


### Steps - What will be included 

Using the Book api, users will be able to search for a specific book and buy it if it is available on the Google play book store. 
Since we are only builidng one page, the links in the nav bar will jump down to specific categories. 

The search bar will be give out example of what it thinks you are typing for.

There will be a second dropdown  'search bar' that gives out catergories that gives out catergories. 'I'm looking for ...' 'Independently published books''Books written by women' and so on. 

// Not sure if i can intergrate thoses in one 

It will also included two blog articles on the page.

Will inlcude a contact us for where users can submit lists of books, or a book that they can't find. 

Footer section will include a CTA to call and email.

#### What I would like to eventually add

Since trying to fix the issue with the Google Book API being down, I unfortunately didn't get the time to do the extra things that I wanted to do. 

- I wanted to add a video in the header with iFrames and then let it be replaced by a photo when it went to mobile 
- I also wanted to add a second API with auotcomplete in the searchbar
