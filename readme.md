# Project 1 

This is the first project of the course. 

## Space Cadet book club 

The goal of this app is to create a sort of virtual book club where people can search for specific books but also see different lists of books that fit within a similar style or vibe. 
Ex: Books written by women, Books that have come out this month, Summer 2019 reads. 
You can also save your list of books that you want to read and check off the books that you have read so that you have a up-to-date list of the books.
